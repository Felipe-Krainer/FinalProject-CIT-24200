## Code Highlights
### Database Context
The `NorthwindContext` manages database access and defines relationships between tables like Customers, Products, and Orders.

### CRUD Functionality
Each feature (Customers, Products, Orders) is built with Razor Pages to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

### Search
Search functionality is implemented in each feature using query strings, enabling dynamic filtering of data.
